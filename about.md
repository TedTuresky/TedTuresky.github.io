Ted is a post-doctoral fellow in developmental cognitive neuroscience at Boston Children’s Hospital/Harvard Medical School. Since joining the Gaab Lab and the Laboratories of Cognitive Neuroscience, Ted has investigated how poverty — and the biological and psychosocial hazards associated with it — affects brain development using structural and functional MRI techniques. Prior to that, Ted examined the motor system in the context of development, aging, and dyslexia, and the auditory system in the context of tinnitus, a condition characterized by the perception of sound in the absence of an external source. A complete list of his publications may be found here. Ted’s prior involvement in tinnitus research in particular spurred him to found a support group for tinnitus sufferers in D.C., which he led for seven years. Ted also serves on the board of directors for the American Tinnitus Association (ATA), where he informs on neurobiology related to tinnitus and the auditory system in general, and advocates for noise health issues. Ted received his graduate training from Guinevere Eden, D.Phil. and the Interdisciplinary Program in Neuroscience at Georgetown University.
