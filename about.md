I am a post-doctoral fellow in developmental cognitive neuroscience at Boston Children’s Hospital/Harvard Medical School. Since joining the [Gaab Lab](https://www.gaablab.com/) and the [Laboratories of Cognitive Neuroscience](http://www.childrenshospital.org/research/labs/laboratories-of-cognitive-neuroscience), I have investigated how poverty — and the biological and psychosocial hazards associated with it — affects brain development using structural and functional MRI techniques. Prior to that, I examined the motor system in the context of development, aging, and dyslexia, and the auditory system in the context of tinnitus, a condition characterized by the perception of sound in the absence of an external source. 

Involvement in tinnitus research in particular spurred me to found a support group for tinnitus sufferers in D.C., which I led for seven years, and then later to serve on the board of directors for the [American Tinnitus Association](https://www.ata.org/), where I inform on neurobiology related to tinnitus and the auditory system in general, and advocate for noise health issues. 

I received my graduate training from [Guinevere Eden, D.Phil.](https://sites.google.com/georgetown.edu/csl/csl-members/guinevere-eden) and the [Interdisciplinary Program in Neuroscience](https://neuroscience.georgetown.edu/) at Georgetown University.
