I'm an assistant professor in the [Linguistics Department](www.ling.upenn.edu) at the University of Pennsylvania and the director of the [Child Language Lab](childlanglab).  

I teach a graduate seminar in [psycholinguistics](/ling607), an undergraduate course in [language and the brain](http://moonshots.langandbrain.com/) and I'm designing a new course for fall 2020 called [data science and language](/datascience).



I'm renovating my website.  Happy New Year!
