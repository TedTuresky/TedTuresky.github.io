I'm an assistant professor in the [Linguistics Department](www.ling.upenn.edu) at the University of Pennsylvania and the director of the [Child Language Lab](childlanglab/about.html).  

I teach a graduate seminar in [psycholinguistics](/ling607), an undergraduate course in [language and the brain](/langandbrain) and a [(proposed) Ben Franklin seminar](https://www.curf.upenn.edu/bfs/information-students/seminars) called [data science and language](/datascience).



I'm renovating my website.  Happy New Year!
